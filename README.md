# Whack a Mole Game

---

## The Whack-a-Mole game is a classic arcade-style game where the player tries to hit as many randomly appearing moles as possible within a set time limit. This particular version of the game was created as part of Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 Challenge using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The game's logic is built using event listeners, intervals, and array manipulation. The moles appear randomly in different holes on the screen, and the player must click on them as quickly as possible to earn points. The score is displayed on the screen in real-time, and the player's progress is tracked throughout the game.

Building the game was a fun and challenging project that helped the developer improve their JavaScript skills. By utilizing a variety of JavaScript techniques and methods, the game was able to be built with a clean and efficient codebase.
